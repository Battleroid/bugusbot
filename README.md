# bugusbot

More configurable version of [bfbot][0] that's not as bad.

Give it a YAML file like the following and let it do its thing:

```yaml
address: "example.com"
port: 64738
username: "ImABot"
moveto: "AFK"
channel: "The Game Channel"
threshold: 4
interval: 60
sayings:
  - "Yo, get on mumble so we can play."
  - "Hello, what's going on."
  - "There's so many people here."
```
